#
# Define the metrics to evaluate models.
#   - Specify the weight for each metric to reflect its priority
#     (higher weight = more importance).
#   - If the weight is set to null, the metric will not be considered during evaluation.
#
# Available metrics:
#   - val_loss: Validation loss (lower is better).
#   - val_acc: Validation accuracy (higher is better).
#   - recall: Recall (higher is better).
#   - fpr: False positive rate (lower is better).
#   - overfitting_tendency: Overfitting tendency (lower is better).
#   - complexity: Model complexity (lower is better).
